### An inquiry into the structure of an album and how it may have changed over time.

------------------------------------------------------------------

I have chosen to focus on the discography of one of my personal favorite bands, Twenty One Pilots. I am interested in Twenty One Pilots' albums specfically as they have been deemed 'concept albums' with distinct, yet somewhat interconnected, storylines and themes. With this in mind, I would be interested in investigating whether or not these themes are solely recognizable in the media content associated with the albums *(such as music videos and linked websites)*, or in the attributes and structures of the albums themselves.
I also chose to focus on the music of Twenty One Pilots as the band has been making music for over a decade and I am intrigued by the potential evolution of the band's albums throughout their career. 

#### **How have certain aspects of Twenty One Pilots' music changed between albums?**

Twenty One Pilots' discography *(that which is available on Spotify)* is made up of four albums, 54 songs, which have been released between 2009 and 2018.
I first decided to analyze the mean values of the various categories provided by Spotify's data for all of the artists' work combined in order to find a kind of average Indie Pop song according to Spotify. I collected data from 103 songs by a total of three different artists.

This primary analysis suggests that the Indie Pop genre consists of moderatly "danceable" (dancability: m = 0.559, sd = 0.104) and postive songs (valence: m = 0.515, sd = 0.192). The data also suggests low ratings of liveness (m = 0.210, sd = 0.157), instrumentalness (m = 0.0162, sd = 0.0988), and acousticness (m = 0.163, sd = 0.243).


| Attributes | | Twenty One Pilots (2009) | Vessel (2013) | Blurryface (2015) | Trench (2018) |
| :--------- |:-- | :----------------------: | :-----------: | :---------------: | :-----------: |
| `Danceability` | Mean | 0.57 | 0.68 | 0.64 | 0.67 |
|  | Standard Deviation | 0.15 | 0.12 | 0.09 | 0.08 |
| `Energy` | Mean | 0.54 | 0.62 | 0.73 | 0.62 |
|  | Standard Deviation | 0.21 | 0.24 | 0.12 | 0.14 |
| `Loudness` | Mean | -7.78 | -6.35 | -5.59 | -7.57 |
|  | Standard Deviation | 2.11 | 2.86 | 0.95 | 1.61 |
| `Liveness` | Mean | 0.15 | 0.14 | 0.16 | 0.19 |
|  | Standard Deviation | 0.08 | 0.06 | 0.12 | 0.12 |
| `Valence` | Mean | 0.31 | 0.56 | 0.54 | 0.44 |
|  | Standard Deviation | 0.17 | 0.20 | 0.17 | 0.18 |
| `Tempo` | Mean | 123 | 126 | 122 | 115 |
|  | Standard Deviation | 23.5 | 24.9 | 28.0 | 23.6 |

Using this data as a baseline, I plan to analyze and compare the data from each separate artist (to each other as well as the overall averages) and discover which aspects of these seemingly *very* different artists' music lend themselves to be grouped into together in a single genre.
