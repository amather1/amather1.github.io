### An inquiry into the structure of an album and how it may have changed over time.

------------------------------------------------------------------

I have chosen to focus on the discography of one of my personal favorite bands, Twenty One Pilots. I am interested in Twenty One Pilots' albums specfically as they have been deemed 'concept albums' with distinct, yet somewhat interconnected, storylines and themes. With this in mind, I would be interested in investigating whether or not these themes are solely recognizable in the media content associated with the albums *(such as music videos and linked websites)*, or in the attributes and structures of the albums themselves.
I also chose to focus on the music of Twenty One Pilots as the band has been making music for over a decade and I am intrigued by the potential evolution of the band's albums throughout their career. 


#### **Have certain aspects of Twenty One Pilots' music changed between albums?**

Twenty One Pilots' discography *(that which is available on Spotify)* is made up of four albums, 54 songs, which have been released between 2009 and 2018. I chose to first analyze the mean values, along with their corresponding standard deviations, of selected categories provided by Spotify's data and compare them between the four albums. I organized these data points into a table *(shown below)*.

| Attributes | | Twenty One Pilots (2009) | Vessel (2013) | Blurryface (2015) | Trench (2018) |
| :--------- |:-- | :----------------------: | :-----------: | :---------------: | :-----------: |
| **Danceability** | `Mean` | 0.57 | 0.68 | 0.64 | 0.67 |
|  | `Standard Deviation` | 0.15 | 0.12 | 0.09 | 0.08 |
| **Energy** | `Mean` | 0.54 | 0.62 | 0.73 | 0.62 |
|  | `Standard Deviation` | 0.21 | 0.24 | 0.12 | 0.14 |
| **Loudness** | `Mean` | -7.78 | -6.35 | -5.59 | -7.57 |
|  | `Standard Deviation` | 2.11 | 2.86 | 0.95 | 1.61 |
| **Liveness** | `Mean` | 0.15 | 0.14 | 0.16 | 0.19 |
|  | `Standard Deviation` | 0.08 | 0.06 | 0.12 | 0.12 |
| **Valence** | `Mean` | 0.31 | 0.56 | 0.54 | 0.44 |
|  | `Standard Deviation` | 0.17 | 0.20 | 0.17 | 0.18 |
| **Tempo** | `Mean` | 123 | 126 | 122 | 115 |
|  | `Standard Deviation` | 23.5 | 24.9 | 28.0 | 23.6 |

Upon first glance, it seems as though the band has created fairly consistent content with each of their four albums. If anything, they may have exhibited a kind of curve in regards to some aspects, such as *loudness* and *valence*, in which they had deviated from their original style but have since tried to return to it. 


#### **Is there a pattern to the structure of Twenty One Pilots' albums?**
Through a comparative analysis of the four albums, I plan to study the potential method by which the band pieces together their albums. Since Twenty One Pilots has been known to make concept albums with distinct storylines, I am interested to know if they tend to use a similar pattern of song styles/vibes between their albums in order to emulate the arc of a storyline.

As an an intial analysis, I felt it most revealing to track the changes *energy* and *tempo* between each track for each of the four albums, hoping to establish a kind of pattern of ballad-type and high energy songs. *The corresponding graphs are shown below*

Using this data as a baseline, I plan to analyze and compare the data from each separate artist (to each other as well as the overall averages) and discover which aspects of these seemingly *very* different artists' music lend themselves to be grouped into together in a single genre.
