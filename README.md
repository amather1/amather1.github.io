### An inquiry into what forms the Indie Pop genre on Spotify

------------------------------------------------------------------

I have chosen to focus on several bands, which I personally listen to and enjoy, that have been assigned to the Indie Pop genre by Spotify. 
When merely listening to these bands' discographies, they do not seemingly *(in my opinion)* match on another in regards to overall sound and style. This made me wonder: What aspects of these various artists' music has led Spotify to group them together? 
#### **How does Spotify define and compile the Indie Pop genre?**

I first decided to analyze the mean values of the various categories provided by Spotify's data for all of the artists' work combined in order to find a kind of average Indie Pop song according to Spotify. I collected data from 103 songs by a total of three different artists.

This primary analysis suggests that the Indie Pop genre consists of moderatly "danceable" (dancability: m = 0.559, sd = 0.104) and postive songs (valence: m = 0.515, sd = 0.192). The data also suggests low ratings of liveness (m = 0.210, sd = 0.157), instrumentalness (m = 0.0162, sd = 0.0988), and acousticness (m = 0.163, sd = 0.243).

| Attributes | Mean | Standard Deviation |
| :--------- | :--: | :----------------: |
| `Danceability` | 0.56 | 0.10 |
| `Energy` | 0.67 | 0.18 |
| `Loudness` | -6.11 | 2.17 |
| `Speechiness` |  | 0.05 |
| `Acousticness` | 0.16 | 0.24 |
| `Instrumentalness` | 0.02 | 0.10 |
| `Liveness` | 0.21 | 0.16 |
| `Valence` | 0.52 | 0.19 |
| `Tempo` | 119 | 28.1 |

Using this data as a baseline, I plan to analyze and compare the data from each separate artist (to each other as well as the overall averages) and discover which aspects of these seemingly *very* different artists' music lend themselves to be grouped into together in a single genre.
