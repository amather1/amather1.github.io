### An inquiry into the structure of an album and how it may have changed over time.

------------------------------------------------------------------

I have chosen to focus on the discography of one of my personal favorite bands, Twenty One Pilots. I am interested in Twenty One Pilots' albums specfically as they have been deemed 'concept albums' with distinct, yet somewhat interconnected, storylines and themes. With this in mind, I would be interested in investigating whether or not these themes are solely recognizable in the media content associated with the albums *(such as music videos and linked websites)*, or in the attributes and structures of the albums themselves.
I also chose to focus on the music of Twenty One Pilots as the band has been making music for over a decade and I am intrigued by the potential evolution of the band's albums throughout their career. 

#### **How does Spotify define and compile the Indie Pop genre?**

Twenty One Pilots' discography *(that which is available on Spotify)* is made up of four albums, 54 songs, which have been released between 2009 and 2018.
I first decided to analyze the mean values of the various categories provided by Spotify's data for all of the artists' work combined in order to find a kind of average Indie Pop song according to Spotify. I collected data from 103 songs by a total of three different artists.

This primary analysis suggests that the Indie Pop genre consists of moderatly "danceable" (dancability: m = 0.559, sd = 0.104) and postive songs (valence: m = 0.515, sd = 0.192). The data also suggests low ratings of liveness (m = 0.210, sd = 0.157), instrumentalness (m = 0.0162, sd = 0.0988), and acousticness (m = 0.163, sd = 0.243).

| Attributes | Mean | Standard Deviation |
| :--------- | :--: | :----------------: |
| `Danceability` | 0.56 | 0.10 |
| `Energy` | 0.67 | 0.18 |
| `Loudness` | -6.11 | 2.17 |
| `Speechiness` |  | 0.05 |
| `Acousticness` | 0.16 | 0.24 |
| `Instrumentalness` | 0.02 | 0.10 |
| `Liveness` | 0.21 | 0.16 |
| `Valence` | 0.52 | 0.19 |
| `Tempo` | 119 | 28.1 |

Using this data as a baseline, I plan to analyze and compare the data from each separate artist (to each other as well as the overall averages) and discover which aspects of these seemingly *very* different artists' music lend themselves to be grouped into together in a single genre.
